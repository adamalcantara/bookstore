# Book Tracker

## Description
This application was built following a course from freeCodeCamp as an exercise to get back into full stack development.

The book tracker allows users to add a book, retrieve the information about books in the database, edit books in the database, and delete a book. It also uses Notistack to notify the users of success or errors. It uses MongoDB as well as express routes to achieve the CRUD functionality.

The app is built using Vite, and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
